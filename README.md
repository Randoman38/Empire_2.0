# Empire_2.0
Based on the 'Empire' cellular automaton by Hopson:

Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mgGQR6oGxI
Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t73z0fzxMlE&t=308s

I made a few changes to the original, and some additions.

Changes:
*Instead of importing world files as images, the world is randomly generated.\n
*You don't see a list of each colony's average strength and population.
*Colony placement isn't only randomized.

Additions:
+GUI
  +Options/ Information Menu
+Simulation can be paused
+Colonies can be placed by left-click, color changed by right-click
+Placement randomizer (places 'n' amount of starter colonists at random locations)
  +Number of 'seeds' of each colony to be placed (1-3)
+Biomes
  +Plains has no special effect
  +Forest makes it harder to move and reproduce
  +Desert doubles 'ageing' speed
+Semi-Customizable world generation
  +World Size (Small, Medium, Large)
  +World type (All plains, all forest, all desert, mix of all)
  +Number of 'seeds' for each biome (Not plains)
+Members of colonies can travel by ocean (Technically in original, but not commented out)

This was an exercise of my coding ability (Although, I will probably continue to make changes on my own).
Thank you to Hopson (Should he ever see this) for inspiring me to make this.
